# Lure

This is my long term project, meaning it's going to be growing and growing. I've started by hand re-typing all 
known elements*, there are errors.

Due to how I have my work-flow set up, I only git push stuff that's finished or at least in a presentable 
state, the pure development I do by using drive from Odeke, which allows you to connect to your Google Drive, 
and use it as your git repo, but it makes stuff easier and just more fluid, specially if you're the only 
developer :P

Before you start working you $ drive pull <my_project>.
After you're done working you $ drive push <my_project>.

And that's all, pretty simple, very useful!
